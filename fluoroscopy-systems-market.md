<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluoroscopy systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With C-arm</li><li>With Table</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluoroscopy systems refer to medical imaging devices that produce real-time X-ray images of the internal organs and structures in the body. There are two main types of fluoroscopy systems in the market: those equipped with a C-arm and those equipped with a table. Fluoroscopy systems with a C-arm consist of a C-shaped arm that can be moved around the patient to obtain different views. On the other hand, fluoroscopy systems with a table enable patients to lie down on a table while the imaging device is positioned above them. Both systems provide valuable medical imaging capabilities for diagnostics and guided procedures.</p></p>
