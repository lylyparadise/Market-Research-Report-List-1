<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nuclear Steam Supply System(NSSS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PWR</li><li>BWR</li><li>PHWR</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) refers to the components responsible for producing steam in a nuclear power plant. There are three main types of NSSS markets: Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR), Boiling Water Reactor (BWR), and Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR). PWRs use water as both the coolant and the moderator, while BWRs use water as a coolant and steam is directly produced in the reactor. PHWRs, on the other hand, use heavy water as a coolant and moderator. Each market type has its own unique features and operational characteristics.</p></p>
