<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion Proof Temperature Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Mount</li><li>Remote Mount</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Explosion-proof temperature switches serve the purpose of preventing accidents in hazardous environments by triggering a response at a certain temperature level. Direct mount switches are installed directly on the equipment or pipeline where the temperature needs monitoring. This allows for quick response time and accurate readings. Remote mount switches, on the other hand, are installed away from the monitored equipment and connected via wiring or tubing. This provides a safer distance from potential explosions, but may result in slower response time and less accurate measurements due to potential heat transfer loss.</p></p>
