<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arteriotomy Closure Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Closure Devices</li><li>Active Closure Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Arteriotomy Closure Devices market consists of two types - Passive Closure Devices and Active Closure Devices. Passive Closure Devices are designed to promote natural healing and clotting after a procedure is completed, with minimal intervention. They rely on the body's own ability to form a clot at the arterial puncture site. On the other hand, Active Closure Devices use specific mechanisms to facilitate the closure of the arterial puncture site. This may include the use of sutures, clips, or metallic devices to assist in the closure process.</p></p>
