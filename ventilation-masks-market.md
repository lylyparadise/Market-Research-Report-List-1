<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilation Masks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrusive Ventilation Masks</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation Masks</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ventilation masks are medical devices used for respiratory support in patients with breathing difficulties. There are two main types: intrusive ventilation masks and non-invasive ventilation masks. Intrusive masks are inserted into the patient's airway through tracheostomy or endotracheal intubation. They are commonly used in critical care settings. On the other hand, non-invasive masks provide respiratory support without the need for invasive procedures. They are usually placed over the patient's nose and mouth or just the nose, and are commonly used in sleep apnea or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment.</p></p>
