<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noise Barrier Wall Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Noise Barrier Wall market includes two types: Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier and Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier. Ground-Mounted Noise Barriers are installed on the ground, typically alongside roads or highways, to reduce the impact of noise pollution on nearby areas. They are cost-effective and easy to install. On the other hand, Structure-Mounted Noise Barriers are attached to existing structures like buildings or bridges. They are suitable for urban areas with limited space and provide noise reduction without taking up additional space. Both types of barriers aim to minimize noise disturbances and improve the quality of surrounding environments.</p></p>
