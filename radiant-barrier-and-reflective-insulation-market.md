<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiant Barrier and Reflective Insulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radiant Barrier</li><li>Reflective Insulation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiant Barrier and Reflective Insulation are two types of building materials used to control heat transfer in buildings. Radiant Barrier is a reflective material that is usually installed in attics or roofs to prevent radiant heat from entering the building. It reflects the heat away, helping to keep the space cool. Reflective Insulation is a product that incorporates a layer of reflective material to reduce heat transfer through conduction. It is typically used in walls, floors, or ceilings to provide thermal insulation and improve energy efficiency. Both types of products help in reducing energy consumption and maintaining comfortable indoor temperatures.</p></p>
