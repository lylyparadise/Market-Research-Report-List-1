<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>VOC Detector market consists of two major types: PID (Photoionization Detector) and Metal-oxide Semiconductor. PID detectors use ultraviolet light to ionize volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air, generating electrical currents that are proportional to their concentration levels. These detectors are highly sensitive and can quickly respond to a wide range of VOCs. On the other hand, Metal-oxide Semiconductor detectors utilize a solid-state sensor that reacts with VOCs, causing changes in electrical conductivity. They are cost-effective and widely used for continuous monitoring in various industries. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring air quality and safety.</p></p>
