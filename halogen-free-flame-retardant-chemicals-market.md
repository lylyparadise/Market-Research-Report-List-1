<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Halogen-Free Flame Retardant Chemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aluminum Hydroxide</li><li>Organo-Phosphorus Chemicals</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Halogen-Free Flame Retardant Chemicals are used to reduce the flammability of materials without the use of halogen chemicals like bromine or chlorine. Two common types of Halogen-Free Flame Retardant Chemicals are Aluminum Hydroxide and Organo-Phosphorus Chemicals. Aluminum Hydroxide works by releasing water vapor when heated, cooling down the material and suppressing the combustion process. Organo-Phosphorus Chemicals act by forming a char layer on the material's surface, which insulates and protects it from flames. Both these chemicals are environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional halogen-based flame retardants.</p></p>
