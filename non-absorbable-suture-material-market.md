<p><h1>Non-absorbable Suture Material Market Provides a Comprehensive Analysis Including a Macro Overview of the Market as well as Micro Details such as Market Size and Competitive Landscape</h1></p><p><strong>Non-absorbable Suture Material Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Non-absorbable suture material is commonly used in surgical procedures to close wounds that require long-term tissue support. Unlike absorbable sutures, non-absorbable sutures are not broken down by the body's natural processes and thus remain in the tissue for an extended period.</p><p>The major advantages of non-absorbable sutures are their durable nature, which provides continued wound support, and their ability to retain strength for longer durations. Common types of non-absorbable sutures include nylon, polyester, polypropylene, silk, and stainless steel.</p><p>The global non-absorbable suture material market has been witnessing significant growth in recent years. This growth can be attributed to factors such as the increasing number of surgical procedures worldwide, rising incidence of chronic diseases requiring surgical interventions, and advancements in surgical techniques and materials. Additionally, the growing geriatric population and the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, orthopedic disorders, and cancer are driving the demand for non-absorbable sutures.</p><p>Furthermore, the market is witnessing the introduction of innovative products with improved biocompatibility and mechanical properties. Key players in the market are investing heavily in research and development activities to enhance their product portfolios. For instance, in February 2021, Ethicon, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, launched its STRATAFIX™ Spiral PDS Plus sutures, which offer superior tissue support and wound closure.</p><p>Overall, the non-absorbable suture material market is projected to experience substantial growth in the coming years. According to the forecast, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.1% during the forecast period. Factors such as the increasing demand for effective wound closure solutions and advancements in surgical techniques will continue to drive market growth.</p></p>
