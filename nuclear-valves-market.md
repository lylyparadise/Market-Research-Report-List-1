<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nuclear Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gate Valve</li><li>Globe Valve</li><li>Butterfly Valve</li><li>Ball Valve</li><li>Check Valve</li><li>Diaphragm Valve</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Nuclear valves are essential components used in nuclear power plants. Gate valves control the flow of liquids or gases by lifting a gate or wedge from the path of the fluid. Globe valves, with a plug-like disc, regulate flow through linear motion. Butterfly valves use a disc to throttle or shut off the flow. Ball valves employ a rotating ball to control fluid flow. Check valves allow one-way flow, preventing backflow. Diaphragm valves isolate fluids using a flexible diaphragm. Other types in the nuclear valves market include pinch valves, angle valves, and control valves.</p></p>
