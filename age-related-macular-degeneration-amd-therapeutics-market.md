<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Therapeutics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet AMD</li><li>Dry AMD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) Therapeutics market is divided into two types - Wet AMD and Dry AMD. Wet AMD occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow beneath the retina, leading to leakage of blood and fluid that damages the macula. Treatments for Wet AMD include anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs that block the growth of these vessels. On the other hand, Dry AMD is the more common type, wherein the macula gradually thins and breaks down, causing vision loss. Presently, there is no approved treatment for Dry AMD, but research is ongoing to develop effective therapies.</p></p>
