<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RFID Digital Lock Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The RFID digital lock market consists of two main types: contact and contactless locks. Contact locks require physical interaction between the lock and the user, usually by inserting a keycard or entering a PIN on a keypad. On the other hand, contactless locks utilize radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, allowing users to gain access by simply waving a keycard or smartphone near the lock. Both types offer convenience and security, but contactless locks are gaining popularity due to their touch-free operation, which reduces the risk of germ transmission.</p></p>
