<p><strong>The Metal Femoral Heads Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HIP Surface Replacement</li><li>Total HIP Replacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal femoral heads market finds application in both the HIP surface replacement and total HIP replacement procedures. In HIP surface replacement, the diseased surface of the femoral head is resurfaced with a metal implant. This procedure preserves more bone and is commonly used for younger patients. On the other hand, total HIP replacement involves replacing the entire damaged hip joint with a metal femoral head, along with a metal socket and a plastic liner. This procedure offers relief from severe arthritis and hip pain. Both these applications drive the demand for metal femoral heads in the market.</p></p>
