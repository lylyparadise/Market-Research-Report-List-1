<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semi-hermetic Compressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-hermetic Reciprocating Compressors</li><li>Semi-hermetic Screw Compressors</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The semi-hermetic compressors market is divided into three main types: semi-hermetic reciprocating compressors, semi-hermetic screw compressors, and others. Semi-hermetic reciprocating compressors are designed with a piston that moves back and forth to compress the refrigerant gas. Semi-hermetic screw compressors, on the other hand, use rotating screws to compress the gas. The "others" category includes various types of semi-hermetic compressors that do not fit into the previous two categories, such as scroll compressors or scroll compressors. These different types of compressors cater to a wide range of industrial and commercial applications.</p></p>
