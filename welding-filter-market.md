<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Welding Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The welding filter market is categorized into two types: active and passive filters. Active filters automatically adjust the shade of the lens based on the intensity of the welding arc, ensuring optimal visibility and protection. These filters are powered by batteries or solar panels. On the other hand, passive filters have a fixed shade that does not adjust. They require the welder to manually flip the filter up or down before and after welding, providing a constant level of protection throughout the welding process.</p></p>
