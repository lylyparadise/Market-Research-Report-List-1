<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Magnetic Strength</li><li>Conventional</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel is classified into two main types based on their magnetic strength: High Magnetic Strength and Conventional. High Magnetic Strength steel is designed for applications requiring high efficiency and strong magnetic properties, making it ideal for power transformers and other high-performance electrical equipment. Conventional Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel, on the other hand, is used in more general electrical applications where high magnetic strength is not a primary concern, such as motors and generators. Both types play a crucial role in the electrical industry.</p></p>
