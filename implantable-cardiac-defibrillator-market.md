<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber</li><li>Dual Chamber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) market consists of two main types: single chamber and dual chamber. Single chamber ICDs have one lead placed in either the right ventricle or the right atrium, monitoring and delivering shocks in only one chamber. Dual chamber ICDs have two leads placed in both chambers, providing more precise monitoring and therapy. Both types are used to treat life-threatening arrhythmias and can restore the heart's normal rhythm by delivering electrical shocks when needed.</p></p>
