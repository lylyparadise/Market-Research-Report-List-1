<p><p>Taxi insurance is a specific type of auto insurance policy designed to cover the risks associated with operating a taxi or a fleet of taxis. It provides protection for taxi drivers, taxi owners, and the passengers against accidents, theft, damage, and legal liabilities.</p><p>The taxi insurance market has witnessed significant growth in recent years, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years. The market growth can be attributed to several factors, including the increasing number of taxi services worldwide, the rising frequency of road accidents, and the growing awareness about the importance of insurance coverage among taxi owners and drivers.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the taxi insurance market is the use of telematics technology.

UBI allows drivers to pay insurance premiums based on their actual usage and driving behavior. This enables taxi drivers to pay lower premiums if they drive during low-risk hours or in safer locations.</p><p>Overall, the taxi insurance market is expected to witness steady growth in the coming years due to the increasing demand for taxi services and the growing awareness about the need for insurance coverage. The market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.6% during the forecast period.</p></p>
