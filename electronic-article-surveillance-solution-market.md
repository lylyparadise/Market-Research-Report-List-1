<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Article Surveillance Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>RF Electronic Article Surveillance Solution</li><li>AM Electronic Article Surveillance Solution</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) is a popular security system used in retail stores to prevent theft. There are two main types of EAS solutions: RF (Radio Frequency) and AM (Acousto Magnetic).</p><p>RF EAS solutions use radio frequency technology to detect the presence of security tags attached to merchandise. These systems are cost-effective, easy to install, and offer reliable detection, making them widely used in retail environments.</p><p>On the other hand, AM EAS solutions utilize acousto magnetic technology, which relies on magnetic fields to detect security tags. These systems provide excellent detection rates, high immunity to interference, and less false alarms but tend to be more expensive than RF systems.</p><p>Both RF and AM EAS solutions play a crucial role in reducing shoplifting incidents, protecting inventory, and enhancing overall store security.</p></p>
